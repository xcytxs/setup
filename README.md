# **Automated Setup Tool Documentation**

## **Overview**

This tool automates the setup of Python environments, ensures required dependencies are installed, manages service ports, and allows for easy configuration through command-line arguments or interactive prompts. It simplifies the process of setting up a Python-based service environment by automating installation tasks and verifying system readiness.

---

## **Features**

1. **Python Installation Verification**: 
   - Ensures that Python is installed before proceeding with the setup process.
   
2. **Automatic Installation of Requirements**: 
   - Installs required Python dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file if present.

3. **Dependency Detection**:
   - Scans Python files in the project directory to detect missing modules and installs them.

4. **Port Availability Check**:
   - Allows the user to select service ports by checking their availability.

5. **Service Configuration**:
   - Allows the user to specify service names and their corresponding ports.

6. **Username and Password Configuration**:
   - Prompts the user to specify a username and password for the service if not passed via arguments.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- **Python**: Python 3.x is required to run this script.
- **pip**: Python's package installer is required for managing dependencies.
- **requirements.txt**: If present, the script will use this file to install necessary dependencies.

---

## **Usage**

### 1. **Verifying Python Installation**

Before proceeding with any setup, the tool ensures that Python is installed on the system by executing:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not found, the script will terminate with an error message.

### 2. **Installing Requirements**

If a `requirements.txt` file is present in the project directory, the script will automatically install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If no `requirements.txt` file is found, the script will skip this step and inform the user.

### 3. **Detecting and Installing Missing Dependencies**

The script will scan through all Python files in the current directory to find any missing dependencies by looking for `import` statements. If any required module is not installed, it will be automatically installed via `pip`.

### 4. **Port Availability Check**

The script allows users to specify ports for services through command-line arguments. If no ports are provided, the script will automatically suggest default ports.

#### **Example Command**:

```bash
python setup.py --services main admin --port 8080 9090
```

In this case:
- The `main` service will be configured to use port `8080`.
- The `admin` service will be configured to use port `9090`.

If the provided port is in use, the script will prompt the user to select another available port.

Alternatively, if no ports are specified, the tool will assign default ports starting from `8000`.

### 5. **Service Configuration (Multiple Services)**

You can specify the names of the services to be configured using the `--services` argument. Each service name should correspond to a specific port, either defined by the user or automatically assigned.

#### **Example Command**:

```bash
python setup.py --services main admin
```

In this case, the script will prompt the user for ports for `main` and `admin` services.

### 6. **Username and Password Configuration**

You can pass a username and password directly via the command line, or the script will prompt for this information if the arguments are omitted.

#### **Example Command**:

```bash
python setup.py --username admin --password secret
```

If the username and password are not passed, the script will ask for the information interactively:

```bash
Enter username: 
Enter password: 
```

---

## **Command-Line Arguments**

- `--services`: List of services to configure (e.g., `main`, `admin`).
- `--port`: List of ports for the services, corresponding to the order of `--services` (e.g., `8080 9090`).
- `--username`: Username for the service.
- `--password`: Password for the service.

### **Example**:

```bash
python setup.py --services main admin --port 8001 8002 --username admin --password secret
```

In this case:
- `main` will use port `8001`.
- `admin` will use port `8002`.
- The username will be `admin` and the password will be `secret`.

---

## **Error Handling**

- **Python Not Found**: If Python is not installed or accessible from the PATH, the script will terminate with an error message and exit.
- **Dependency Installation Failed**: If any required module cannot be installed, the script will report the failure but continue with the setup process for the other modules.
- **Port in Use**: If a specified port is already in use, the script will ask the user to select a different port until an available one is found.

---

## **Example Workflow**

1. User runs the script:
   ```bash
   python setup.py --services main admin --port 8080 9090 --username admin --password secret
   ```

2. The script checks for Python installation:
   ```bash
   Python is installed.
   ```

3. It checks for a `requirements.txt` file and installs dependencies if found.

4. The script scans for missing dependencies in Python files and installs them.

5. The script verifies that ports `8080` and `9090` are available for `main` and `admin` services.

6. The username and password are confirmed either via command-line arguments or interactive prompts.

7. Setup is complete with the specified configurations.

---

## **Customization**

You can modify the script for additional customization:
- Change default port numbers (currently starting at `8000`).
- Modify or add further dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- Adjust interactive prompts to better suit your environment.
